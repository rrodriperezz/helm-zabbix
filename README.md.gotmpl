# Introduction

This Helm chart installs [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com) in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Important notes

> **Break change 3.0.0**
* Will be used Postgresql 14.x and Zabbix 6.x.
* This version removes the possibility to specify database username/password per
  subsection in favor of specifying all of them centrally at one place.
* Also, the names of the values have changed from upper to lowercase.
* It is now possible to start the Zabbix Server pods with replicas of more than 1.
  HA functionality of Zabbix will automatically be enabled and it is made sure that 
  the database schema publication will only happen once, and not by all of the Zabbix
  server pods at the same time.
* More info: https://github.com/cetic/helm-zabbix/pull/54

> **Break change 2.0.0**
* Will be used Postgresql 14.x and Zabbix 6.x.
* This version implements a central way of managing database access credentials 
using a secret, which then will be respected by all the components
installed by this chart: zabbixserver, zabbixweb and postgresql.
* The secret must contain a number of keys indicating DB host, DB name,
user and password and can direct towards a database installed within
this chart, or an external database.
* The benefit of this is that now the database can respect the values 
in the central DB access secret and initialize accordingly.
* Last but not least, the credential secret can be chosen to be
auto-generated (password will be set to a random string) at chart
installation, if postgresql.enabled is set to true. With this, an easy
to use "out-of-the-box" installation with as little customizations as
possible is possible, while still obtaining a good level of security.
* More info: https://github.com/cetic/helm-zabbix/pull/53

> **Break change 1.0.0**
* Will be used Postgresql 14.x and Zabbix 6.x.
* The installation of any component of chart is optional for easy integration with the official chart: https://git.zabbix.com/projects/ZT/repos/kubernetes-helm/
* More info: https://github.com/cetic/helm-zabbix/issues/42

# Zabbix components

## Zabbix Server

**Zabbix server** is the central process of Zabbix software.

The server performs the polling and trapping of data, it calculates triggers, sends notifications to users. It is the central component to which Zabbix agents and proxies report data on availability and integrity of systems. The server can itself remotely check networked services (such as web servers and mail servers) using simple service checks. Zabbix Server can be operated in a High Availability mode since version 6.0 which is automatically enabled by this Helm chart when setting the Zabbix server component to run more than 1 replica. In this HA mode, all Zabbix server instances periodically send a heartbeat to the Database server (just updating a timestamp in a table) as well as which of the nodes is the "active" one. In case the active node does not send a heartbeat within a certain time, any of the remaining ones automatically take over. It is everytime possible to join new nodes to the HA cluster by just raising the amount of replicas of the Zabbix server.


## Zabbix Agent

> **zabbix-agent2** is supported in this helm chart.

**Zabbix agent** is deployed on a monitoring target to actively monitor local resources and applications (hard drives, memory, processor statistics etc).

## Zabbix Web (frontend)

**Zabbix web** interface is a part of Zabbix software. It is used to manage resources under monitoring and view monitoring statistics.

## Zabbix Proxy

> This helm chart installs Zabbix proxy with SQLite3 support

**Zabbix proxy** is a process that may collect monitoring data from one or more monitored devices and send the information to the Zabbix server, essentially working on behalf of the server. All collected data is buffered locally and then transferred to the **Zabbix server** the proxy belongs to.

## PostgreSQL

A database is required for zabbix to work, in this helm chart we're using Postgresql 14.x.

> We use plain postgresql database by default WITHOUT persistence. If you want persistence or would like to use TimescaleDB instead, check the comments in the ``values.yaml`` file.


## Configure the chart

The items of section [Configuration](#Configuration) can be set via ``--set`` flag during installation or change the values according to the need of the environment in ``helm-zabbix/values.yaml`` file.

### Configure central database access related settings

All settings referring to how the different components that this Chart installs access the Zabbix Database (either an external, already existing database or one deployed within this Helm chart) are being configured centrally under the ``db_access`` section of the ``values.yaml`` file.

By default, this Chart will deploy it's own very simple PostgreSQL database. All settings relevant to how to access this database will be held in one central unified secret with the name configured with the ``db_access.unified_secret_name`` setting.

Instead of letting the Chart automatically generate such a secret with a random password (which will NOT be recreated on upgrade/redeploy), you can supply such a secret yourself. Use ``db_access.unified_secret_autocreate=false`` in such a case and read the comments in ``values.yaml`` for how the values inside the secret should be set.

If you want to connect your Zabbix installation to a Postgres database deployed using the [CrunchyData PGO Operator](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/), you can use the secret that PGO generates for your DB automatically directly to connect Zabbix to it, by just referring to its name with the ``db_access.unified_secret_name`` setting to it.

There is also the possibility to set all DB relevant settings directly inside the ``db_access`` section of the ``values.yaml`` file by using the settings noted there (``db_server_host``, ``postgres_user``, etc). If doing so, you still can use one single secret to told just and only the database password. If you want to do so, supply the ``db_access.postgres_password_secret`` and ``db_access.postgres_password_secret_key`` settings, accordingly.

## Configure Postgresql database to match with your performance expectations

While the default database configuration shipped with this Chart is fine for most (very small, for testing only) Zabbix installations, you will want to set some specific settings to better match your setup. First of all, you should consider enabling Postgresql database persistence (``postgresql.persistence.enabled``), as otherwise all your changes and historical data will be gone as soon as you remove the installation of Zabbix. Additionally, you might want to tune Postgresql by supplying extra postgresql runtime parameters using the ``postgresql.extraRuntimeParameters`` dictionary:

```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storage_size: 50Gi
  extraRuntimeParameters:
    max_connections: 250
    dynamic_shared_memory_type: posix
    shared_buffers: 4GB
    temp_buffers: 16MB
    work_mem: 128MB
    maintenance_work_mem: 256MB
    effective_cache_size: 6GB
    min_wal_size: 80MB
```

Alternatively, you can add your own configuration file for postgresql (using a ConfigMap and the ``postgresql.extraVolumes`` setting) to mount it into the postgresql container and referring to this config file with the ``postgresql.extraRuntimeParameters`` set to:

```yaml
postgresql:
  extraRuntimeParameters:
    config.file: /path/to/your/config.file
```

### Configure the way how to expose Zabbix service:

- **Ingress**: The ingress controller must be installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **IngressRoute**: The custom resource definition if you use the [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) ingress controller.
- **Route**: The ingress controller used by Red Hat Openshift, based on HAProxy
- **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). You’ll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting ``NodeIP:NodePort``.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

# Installation

Access a Kubernetes cluster.

Add Helm repo:

```bash
helm repo add cetic https://cetic.github.io/helm-charts
```

Update the list helm chart available for installation (like ``apt-get update``). This is recommend before install/upgrade a helm chart:

```bash
helm repo update
```

Export default values of chart ``helm-zabbix`` to file ``$HOME/zabbix_values.yaml``:

```bash
helm show values cetic/zabbix > $HOME/zabbix_values.yaml
```

Change the values according to the environment in the file ``$HOME/zabbix_values.yaml``.

See the example of installation in kind in this [tutorial](docs/example/README.md).

Test the installation/upgrade with command:

```bash
helm upgrade --install zabbix cetic/zabbix \
 --dependency-update \
 --create-namespace \
 -f $HOME/zabbix_values.yaml -n monitoring --debug --dry-run
```

Install/upgrade the Zabbix with command:

```bash
helm upgrade --install zabbix cetic/zabbix \
 --dependency-update \
 --create-namespace \
 -f $HOME/zabbix_values.yaml -n monitoring --debug
```

View the pods.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

# How to access Zabbix

After deploying the chart in your cluster, you can use the following command to access the zabbix frontend service: 

View informations of ``zabbix`` services.

```bash
kubectl describe services zabbix-web -n monitoring
```

Listen on port 8888 locally, forwarding to 80 in the service ``APPLICATION_NAME-zabbix-web``. Example:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/zabbix-zabbix-web 8888:80 -n monitoring
```

Access Zabbix:

* URL: http://localhost:8888
* Login: **Admin**
* Password: **zabbix**

# Troubleshooting
